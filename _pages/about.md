About me
======
I’m an associate professor in the Department of Sociology at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica of Chile. My primary research interests include economic inequality and disasters. I am also interested in quantitative methodology, particularly in applying rigorous causal inference based on experimental and observational research designs to substantive social problems.
